# Kjerneverk Tone and Voice Guidelines

## Core Tone Attributes

### Pragmatic
We focus on solving real problems, not theoretical possibilities. Every feature, every construct exists because it addresses a genuine need encountered in actual work with generative AI.

**Example**: 
- ✅ "RiotPrompt exists because OpenAI and Anthropic use different section delimiters for large contexts"
- ❌ "RiotPrompt leverages cutting-edge AI paradigms"

### Opinionated
We have strong views about how to work with generative AI. We don't pretend all approaches are equally valid. We built these tools because existing solutions were inadequate.

**Example**:
- ✅ "Most planning tools generate inadequate plans. They're just markdown files that pile up without structure."
- ❌ "There are many approaches to planning, and RiotPlan offers one option."

### Process-Focused
We emphasize *how* you work, not just *what* you produce. The journey matters as much as the destination. Process, lifecycle, and ways of thinking are central to our message.

**Example**:
- ✅ "A plan isn't just tasks—it's a lifecycle from idea exploration through execution"
- ❌ "RiotPlan helps you organize your tasks"

### Intellectually Honest
We don't oversimplify. We use proper technical terms. We acknowledge complexity. Our audience can handle sophisticated concepts.

**Example**:
- ✅ "This is metacognitive programming—prompting about prompting, thinking about thinking"
- ❌ "This makes AI easier to use"

## What We Are

### Transparent About Complexity
Generative AI work *is* complex. Managing context, maintaining process, ensuring ownership—these are sophisticated challenges. We don't pretend otherwise.

**Use words like**: ontology, structure, metacognitive, construct, lifecycle, process

**Don't shy away from**: technical terminology, philosophical concepts, abstract thinking

### Confident But Not Arrogant
We know these approaches work because we use them ourselves. We're confident in the value they provide. But we're not claiming to have all the answers.

**Example**:
- ✅ "This is how I want to work with generative AI, and I believe others will find value in these approaches too"
- ❌ "This is the only way to work with AI" or "Everyone should use this"

### Personal Yet Professional
This is a passion project, not a corporate product. The voice reflects that—it's personal, direct, and honest. But it's still professional and well-thought-out.

**Example**:
- ✅ "I built RiotPlan because I was doing really complicated things—migrations, integrations—and needed plans that did analysis, plans for plans"
- ❌ "Our enterprise-grade solution delivers synergistic value"

## What We Are Not

### Not Oversimplified
We don't dumb things down to make them more accessible. If understanding Kjerneverk requires engaging with complex ideas, that's okay. Our audience is technical and capable.

**Avoid**:
- "Easy AI for everyone"
- "No coding required"
- "Simple solutions"

### Not Hype-Driven
We don't use buzzwords or chase trends. We don't claim to be revolutionary or disruptive. We're solving real problems with thoughtful approaches.

**Avoid**:
- "Revolutionary AI framework"
- "Next-generation paradigm"
- "Disruptive technology"

### Not Marketing-Speak
This isn't a company. We're not selling anything. We don't use corporate language or try to appeal to everyone.

**Avoid**:
- "Leverage synergies"
- "Best-in-class solutions"
- "Unlock potential"

## Voice Characteristics

### Direct
Get to the point. Don't bury the message in fluff.

**Example**:
- ✅ "LLMs generate content that hits the mark, but not quite"
- ❌ "In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, organizations are discovering that while large language models offer unprecedented capabilities..."

### Specific
Use concrete examples. Reference real tools (Beads, Word, Microsoft Project). Name specific problems.

**Example**:
- ✅ "OpenAI uses Markdown sections for large contexts. Anthropic uses XML tags. Google has a rich collection of sections."
- ❌ "Different providers have different approaches"

### Thoughtful
Take time to explain *why*, not just *what*. Show the thinking behind decisions.

**Example**:
- ✅ "We're too often distracted by tools and not paying attention to process. As models get better, which specific model you use matters less."
- ❌ "RiotPrompt works with multiple models"

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure

**Start with the insight**: Lead with the core idea, not background or context.

**Example**:
- ✅ "The thing is bigger than just the thing. When you create a prompt, you're not just writing text—you're engaging in a process."
- ❌ "In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has seen remarkable advances..."

### Language

**Use active voice**: "We built this" not "This was built"

**Use first person when appropriate**: "I wanted to create..." is fine for personal context

**Use second person to engage**: "You're not just writing text" connects with readers

**Be specific about who/what**: Don't say "the system" or "the platform"—say "RiotPrompt" or "the construct"

### Rhythm

**Vary sentence length**: Mix short, punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones

**Use lists**: Break down complex ideas into bullet points

**Use emphasis sparingly**: Bold for key concepts, italics for emphasis, but don't overdo it

## Examples of Good Tone

### From VISION.md
> "When you create a prompt, you're not just writing text to send to an LLM. When you create a plan, you're not just making a task list. When you write a document, you're not just generating output. **You're engaging in a process.**"

**Why it works**: Direct, specific, builds rhythm, ends with emphasis on the key insight

### From CORE-MESSAGE.md
> "Large language models generate content that **'hits the mark, but not quite.'** They're excellent at pattern-matching from their training data. They can produce documents, plans, and responses that look good on the surface. But they're not *yours*."

**Why it works**: Memorable phrase, honest assessment, personal connection ("yours")

## Examples of Bad Tone

### Too Corporate
> "Kjerneverk delivers enterprise-grade solutions for AI-assisted workflows, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to unlock unprecedented value for organizations."

**Why it fails**: Buzzwords, no specificity, sounds like marketing

### Too Simplistic
> "Kjerneverk makes AI easy! Just click a button and get amazing results!"

**Why it fails**: Oversimplifies, promises magic, doesn't respect audience intelligence

### Too Academic
> "The epistemological framework underlying Kjerneverk's architectural paradigm represents a fundamental reconceptualization of the ontological substrate of human-AI interaction modalities."

**Why it fails**: Unnecessarily complex, obscures rather than clarifies, sounds pretentious

## Audience-Specific Adjustments

### For Developers (Technical Documentation)
- More code examples
- Specific API references
- Architecture details
- Still maintain the philosophical grounding

### For Users (Main Website, READMEs)
- More "why" than "how"
- Focus on problems and solutions
- Concrete examples of use cases
- Still don't oversimplify

### For AI Assistants (When They Generate Content)
- Emphasize key phrases from CORE-MESSAGE.md
- Reference foundational concepts from VISION.md
- Maintain consistency with established tone
- Don't let them fall into marketing-speak

## The Golden Rule

**Write as if explaining to a smart colleague who's skeptical but open-minded.**

They don't need things dumbed down, but they do need clear explanations. They'll spot BS immediately, so be honest. They appreciate directness and specificity. They want to understand *why*, not just *what*.

If you can convince that colleague, you've got the tone right.
