# Kjerneverk Target Audience

## Primary Audience

**Technical users working with generative AI who are closer to programming than not.**

### Characteristics

**Technical Comfort**
- Comfortable with command-line interfaces
- Understands concepts like APIs, environment variables, JSON/XML
- May or may not be professional developers, but thinks like one
- Not intimidated by technical documentation

**Generative AI Experience**
- Already using LLMs regularly (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Frustrated with limitations of current approaches
- Doing complex work that requires thoughtful planning
- Wants more control over AI-assisted workflows

**Problem-Solving Mindset**
- Values process and structure
- Willing to invest time in better approaches
- Skeptical of "magic bullet" solutions
- Appreciates intellectual honesty about complexity

**Work Context**
- Software development, technical writing, research, analysis
- Projects that span multiple sessions
- Work that requires maintaining context over time
- Tasks where "good enough" outputs aren't good enough

## How They'll Use Kjerneverk

### As a Library
Developers integrating Kjerneverk into their applications:
- Building AI-assisted tools
- Creating custom workflows
- Need structured formats that work across models

### From the Command Line
Power users who prefer CLI tools:
- `riotprompt execute my-prompt -m claude-3-opus`
- `riotplan create my-feature --steps 7`
- `riotdoc draft --level expand`
- Set API keys via environment variables
- Work outside of IDEs

### Via MCP Servers
Users of AI assistants (Cursor, Claude Desktop):
- Want AI assistants to manage prompts/plans/docs
- Benefit from structured resources and tools
- Use whatever model is attached to their session

### Through Standalone Apps (Future)
Less technical users who want GUI interfaces:
- macOS apps, web interfaces
- Still technical enough to appreciate structure
- Want user-friendly access to Kjerneverk concepts

## Secondary Audiences

### AI Assistants Themselves
When AI assistants generate content about Kjerneverk:
- Need to understand core concepts accurately
- Should reference foundational documents
- Must avoid marketing-speak and oversimplification
- Should emphasize tool independence and process focus

### Open Source Contributors
Developers who want to contribute:
- Understand TypeScript, Node.js ecosystem
- Appreciate well-architected systems
- Value clear documentation and testing
- Want to extend or improve the tools

## Who This Is NOT For

### Non-Technical Users
People who:
- Don't use command-line tools
- Aren't comfortable with technical concepts
- Just want "easy AI"
- Expect point-and-click simplicity

**Note**: We may eventually provide GUI apps for broader audiences, but the core tools are designed for technical users first.

### People Seeking Simple Solutions
Users who:
- Want quick fixes without understanding process
- Expect tools to "just work" without configuration
- Don't want to invest time in learning new approaches
- Are satisfied with "good enough" LLM outputs

### Corporate Buyers
Organizations looking for:
- Enterprise features and support
- Vendor relationships
- Compliance certifications
- Sales and marketing materials

**Note**: This is a passion project, not a commercial product. No sales team, no enterprise features, no SLAs.

## Audience Personas

### Persona 1: The Thoughtful Developer
**Name**: Alex
**Context**: Building AI-assisted development tools
**Pain Point**: Tired of rewriting prompts for different models
**Uses Kjerneverk**: As a library in their application
**Values**: Clean abstractions, tool independence, good documentation

### Persona 2: The Power User
**Name**: Jordan
**Context**: Technical writer doing complex research projects
**Pain Point**: LLM-generated documents are "close but not quite"
**Uses Kjerneverk**: CLI tools with API keys
**Values**: Control over process, history tracking, structured workflows

### Persona 3: The AI-Assisted Worker
**Name**: Sam
**Context**: Software engineer using Cursor for development
**Pain Point**: Plans generated by AI assistants are too simplistic
**Uses Kjerneverk**: Via MCP in Cursor
**Values**: Deep planning, analysis before action, multi-session workflows

### Persona 4: The Researcher
**Name**: Morgan
**Context**: Academic or industry researcher
**Pain Point**: Need to track sources and construction of arguments
**Uses Kjerneverk**: RiotDoc for research papers and reports
**Values**: Evidence tracking, process documentation, intellectual rigor

## Communication Preferences

### What Resonates

**Honesty About Complexity**
"This is metacognitive programming—it's sophisticated work that requires sophisticated thinking."

**Specific Examples**
"OpenAI uses Markdown sections. Anthropic uses XML tags. RiotPrompt abstracts these differences."

**Problem-First Framing**
"LLMs generate content that hits the mark, but not quite. Here's how to take control."

**Process Over Tools**
"As models improve, which tool you use matters less. What matters is your process."

### What Doesn't Resonate

**Oversimplification**
"Make AI easy with one click!"

**Hype and Buzzwords**
"Revolutionary next-generation AI paradigm"

**Corporate Speak**
"Leverage synergies to unlock value"

**Condescension**
"Even non-technical users can..."

## Engagement Channels

### Where They Are

**GitHub**
- Primary distribution channel
- Where they discover projects
- Where they contribute

**Technical Blogs**
- Medium, personal blogs
- Looking for deep dives, not tutorials
- Want to understand philosophy and architecture

**Developer Communities**
- Reddit (r/programming, r/MachineLearning)
- Hacker News
- Discord servers for AI tools

**AI Assistant Ecosystems**
- Cursor community
- Claude Desktop users
- MCP ecosystem

### Where They're Not

**Social Media (General)**
- Not on Twitter/X for tech content
- Not on Facebook
- Not on Instagram

**Marketing Channels**
- Don't respond to ads
- Skeptical of promotional content
- Ignore cold outreach

## Content Strategy for This Audience

### Documentation
- Comprehensive but well-organized
- Code examples with explanations
- Architecture documents for understanding design
- Philosophy documents for understanding "why"

### READMEs
- Quick start that actually works
- Clear installation instructions
- Links to deeper documentation
- Honest about complexity

### Blog Posts / Articles
- Deep dives into specific problems
- "How I built this" narratives
- Philosophical explorations
- Technical architecture explanations

### Community Engagement
- Responsive to issues and PRs
- Thoughtful in discussions
- Open about limitations
- Collaborative on improvements

## Success Metrics

We'll know we're reaching the right audience when:

1. **GitHub stars from developers** who actually use the tools
2. **Issues and PRs** that show deep engagement
3. **Blog posts and articles** from users explaining their workflows
4. **MCP adoption** in AI assistant communities
5. **Word-of-mouth** recommendations in technical communities

We're NOT measuring:
- Total user count (quality over quantity)
- Social media followers
- Marketing metrics
- Enterprise adoption

## The Bottom Line

Our audience is **smart, technical, and skeptical**. They:
- Don't need things dumbed down
- Appreciate intellectual honesty
- Value process and structure
- Want control over their work
- Will invest time in better approaches

We speak to them as **peers**, not as customers or users. We respect their intelligence, acknowledge complexity, and provide the tools and concepts they need to work better with generative AI.
