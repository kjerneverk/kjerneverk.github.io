# RiotDoc

**Documents as Process**

## The Core Insight

A document is bigger than its output.

It's a **construct** that includes:
- **Construction of meaning**: How you build understanding from sources and references
- **The conversation**: Research, evidence, audience analysis, thinking
- **Process tracking**: Like academic papers show their recipe, all documents should track creation
- **Evolution**: From idea → outline → draft → revision with full history

## The Problem

### Before RiotDoc

**Word processor blank canvas**: Fire up Word and start typing. No structure, no process, just a blank page.

**LLM "close enough" generation**: Ask an LLM to generate a document. It produces something that "hits the mark, but not quite"—pattern-matched from training data, not constructed from your thinking.

**Lost context**: Even when you write yourself, you lose the research, the evidence, the conversations that shaped the document. The output exists, but the process is gone.

**No ownership**: Documents generated by LLMs aren't truly yours. They don't capture your unique context, your research, your thinking.

## The Solution

### With RiotDoc

**Template-driven workflows**: Templates define questions, approaches, and structure. Different workflows for different document types (blog posts, research papers, emails, reports).

**Conversational guidance**: Ask 2-5 questions at a time, not overwhelming forms. Build the document through conversation.

**Full history tracking**: Everything is captured:
- Timeline of events
- Conversation history  
- Research and evidence
- Draft versions
- Revision notes

**Process documentation**: Like academic papers show their sources and methodology, RiotDoc documents show how they were constructed.

**Tool independence**: Works with any model or no model at all. From CLI, via MCP, or through future GUI applications.

## How It Works

### From the Command Line

```bash
# Create a new document
riotdoc create my-blog-post --type blog-post

# Generate an outline
riotdoc outline

# Create a draft
riotdoc draft --level expand

# Revise the draft
riotdoc revise

# Export final document
riotdoc export
```

### Via MCP

Install in Cursor or Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "riotdoc": {
      "command": "riotdoc-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

AI assistants can then guide you through document creation with conversational workflows.

### As a Library

```typescript
import { createDocument, generateDraft } from 'riotdoc';

const doc = await createDocument({
  type: 'blog-post',
  title: 'Understanding Kjerneverk',
  approach: 'structured'
});

const draft = await generateDraft(doc, { level: 'expand' });
```

## Document Structure

```
my-document/
├── DOCUMENT.md          # Current version
├── META.md              # Metadata, audience, purpose
├── OUTLINE.md           # Document structure
├── drafts/              # Version history
│   ├── draft-v0.1.md
│   ├── draft-v0.2.md
│   └── draft-v1.0.md
├── research/            # Evidence and sources
│   ├── source-1.md
│   └── source-2.md
└── .history/            # Full conversation history
    ├── timeline.jsonl
    └── prompts/
        ├── 001-initial-idea.md
        └── 002-outline-discussion.md
```

## The Lifecycle

### 1. Idea Phase

What do you want to write about?
- Topic and angle
- Target audience
- Core message
- Initial thoughts

### 2. Outline Phase

Structure your thinking:
- Main sections
- Key points
- Flow and organization
- Evidence needed

### 3. Draft Phase

Create the content:
- Varying levels of AI assistance
- Expand outline into prose
- Incorporate research
- Version tracking (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)

### 4. Revision Phase

Refine and improve:
- Address feedback
- Strengthen arguments
- Improve clarity
- Polish language

### 5. Publication Phase

Prepare for release:
- SEO metadata
- Categories and tags
- Final formatting
- Version 1.0

## Key Features

### Template-Driven

Templates define:
- Questions to ask (by phase)
- Approaches available
- Document structure
- Workflow steps

Change a template → entire workflow adapts.

### Conversational Guidance

Not overwhelming forms—2-5 questions at a time. Build the document through natural conversation.

### Multiple Approaches

Different strategies for each document type:
- **Blog Post**: Quick & Direct, Structured, Multi-Post Series
- **Research Paper**: Literature Review, Original Research, Meta-Analysis
- **Email**: Quick Message, Formal Communication, Newsletter

### Full History Tracking

Everything captured:
- Timeline of all events
- Conversation history (`.history/prompts/`)
- Research and evidence
- Draft versions with diffs
- Revision notes

### Checkpoints

Create snapshots for:
- Experimentation
- Rollback if needed
- Comparing approaches
- Archiving milestones

### Varying AI Assistance

Choose your level:
- **Full generation**: AI writes based on your outline
- **Expansion**: AI expands your bullet points
- **Light editing**: AI polishes your prose
- **No AI**: Just use the structure

## Use Cases

### For Blog Posts

Write posts that reflect your thinking, not just pattern-matched content. Track research, outline, draft, revise.

### For Research Papers

Capture sources, evidence, methodology. Show how you constructed your arguments, like academic papers should.

### For Work Documents

Emails, reports, proposals—track audience analysis, key messages, revisions. Make your thinking explicit.

### For Technical Writing

Documentation, guides, tutorials—maintain history of decisions, incorporate feedback, track versions.

## The Difference

### Traditional Word Processors

- Blank canvas
- No structure
- Lost process
- Just the output

### LLM Generation

- Pattern-matched
- Not truly yours
- No context
- "Close enough"

### RiotDoc

- Structured process
- Full history
- Your thinking embedded
- Truly yours

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @riotprompt/riotdoc

## Philosophy

RiotDoc embodies the Kjerneverk principle: **the thing is bigger than just the thing**.

A document isn't just output. It's the construction of meaning. It's the research, the thinking, the conversations that shaped it. It's a process that makes your work truly yours.

When you read a good document, there's meaning in it. But as an author, you spend so much time constructing that meaning from various sources and references. RiotDoc captures that process.

Even for something as mundane as a work email—there's science in understanding your audience, their motivations, what you're trying to achieve. RiotDoc makes that explicit.
