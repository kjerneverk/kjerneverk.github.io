# Kjerneverk Core Message

## The Essence

**Kjerneverk provides structured formats for working with generative AI.**

It moves you away from:
- ❌ Freeform prompts
- ❌ Unstructured plans  
- ❌ Documents generated without your input

Towards:
- ✅ **Control** over what you send to models
- ✅ **Ownership** of outputs that are truly yours
- ✅ **Constructs** with tools and infrastructure
- ✅ **Process** that makes your thinking explicit

## The Core Problem

Large language models generate content that **"hits the mark, but not quite."**

They're excellent at pattern-matching from their training data. They can produce documents, plans, and responses that look good on the surface. But they're not *yours*. They don't capture *your* thinking, *your* research, *your* unique context.

## The Solution

Kjerneverk gives you tools to **take back control**.

Not by avoiding LLMs—they're incredibly powerful. But by providing **structure** around how you work with them:

### Structured Formats

Instead of freeform text, you work with **constructs**:
- **Prompts** with sections (persona, instructions, context, constraints)
- **Plans** with lifecycle (idea → shaping → execution → completion)
- **Documents** with process (research → outline → draft → revision)

### Tool Independence

Your work isn't locked to one model or one IDE:
- Write prompts that work with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini
- Create plans that execute via CLI, MCP, or GUI
- Build documents using any model or no model at all

### Process Over Tools

As models improve, **which tool you use matters less**. What matters is:
- How you structure your approach
- How you maintain context and history
- How you ensure outputs reflect your thinking

## What This Means in Practice

### For Prompts (RiotPrompt)

**Without structure**: You write different prompts for different models. You lose history. You can't evolve prompts over time.

**With Kjerneverk**: One prompt format that translates automatically. Revisions tracked. Experimentation supported. Your prompts become reusable assets.

### For Plans (RiotPlan)

**Without structure**: You depend on tools to generate inadequate plans. Or you create markdown files that pile up. Or you use issue trackers that don't support deep thinking.

**With Kjerneverk**: Standard lifecycle from idea exploration through execution. Analysis before action. Plans that span multiple sessions. Infrastructure for complex work.

### For Documents (RiotDoc)

**Without structure**: You either write from scratch in Word, or you ask an LLM to generate something "close enough."

**With Kjerneverk**: Documents that capture the construction of meaning. Research and evidence tracked. Conversation history preserved. Your thinking embedded in the output.

## The Deeper Insight

**The thing is bigger than just the thing.**

A prompt isn't just text. A plan isn't just tasks. A document isn't just output.

They're all **processes**. They have **lifecycles**. They represent **ways of thinking**.

Kjerneverk makes this explicit. It gives you constructs that acknowledge the full scope of what you're doing when you work with generative AI.

## Why This Matters Now

We're at an inflection point with generative AI:

1. **Models are getting better** - The specific model you use matters less each month
2. **Tools are proliferating** - Every IDE, every platform wants to add AI features
3. **We're drowning in output** - LLMs can generate endless content, but is it *yours*?

This is the moment to establish **how you want to work** with these tools. Not to be distracted by which model or which IDE, but to focus on **process, structure, and ownership**.

## The Message for Different Audiences

### For Developers
"Build AI-assisted applications with structured formats that work across any model. Stop rewriting prompts for each provider."

### For Technical Users
"Take control of your AI workflows. Structure your prompts, plans, and documents so they're truly yours, not just pattern-matched from training data."

### For AI Assistants
"When generating content about Kjerneverk, emphasize: structured formats, tool independence, process over tools, control and ownership. This isn't about AI development—it's about redefining how we work with generative AI."

## Key Phrases to Use

- "Structured formats for generative AI"
- "Control and ownership over LLM outputs"
- "The thing is bigger than just the thing"
- "Process over tools"
- "Tool-independent constructs"
- "Make your thinking explicit"
- "Truly yours, not pattern-matched"

## Key Phrases to Avoid

- "AI development tools" (wrong framing)
- "AI-assisted software development" (too narrow)
- "Prompt engineering" (too limiting)
- "Task automation" (misses the point)

## The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Kjerneverk provides structured formats for the core work you do with generative AI. Instead of freeform prompts, unstructured plans, or documents generated without your input, you get constructs with tools and infrastructure that give you control. It's about making your work truly yours—not just pattern-matched from training data. And it works with any model, any tool, any environment."

## The One-Liner

"Structured formats for generative AI that give you control over your prompts, plans, and documents."

## The Tweet

"Stop letting LLMs generate content that's 'close enough.' Kjerneverk gives you structured formats (prompts, plans, docs) that work with any model and put you in control. #GenerativeAI #Metacognitive"
